Developers Notes:
Originality we wanted to create a web app that could use optical character recognition(OCR)
to allow users to create a list of ingredients, however, due to time constraints and a lack
of satisfaction from developers the idea was scrapped. Instead we allowed users to insert
multiple individual ingredients and the app would search based on those.

Prerequisites:
    - python2
    - flask (pip install Flask / c9: sudo easy_install Flask)
    - flask_cors (api_calls)
    - mongodb 3.5.*
    - bcrypt
    - PyMongo
To run, go to terminal where app.py is located and put in:
	- FLASK_APP=app.py
	- python -m flask run
Click on the link the pops up from the terminal (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which is == http://localhost:5000)
Login using the username nice and password nice
or Create a new user by pressing the + button.
